Branden shared his side project called “The Office Gifinator” that he’s currently building in React. It allows you to search for gifs relating to the TV show “The Office”. Once the user types a keyword into the search bar, it loads the first 25 gif results. He has implemented infinite scroll which upon reaching the bottom of the results will then load the next 15 results and so on. He retrieves the gif keyword search results using an external API through developers.giphy.com. 

=> He’s still figuring out how to search for gifs specific to the TV show and not general office-related gifs. 

=> He also wants to be able to show previews in lieu of loading the gifs to make the site faster and fix up the view to look cleaner. He’s considering using this as a base for his React/Redux project.
